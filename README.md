Study Buddy Agent is an AI-powered personal study planner designed to help students manage their time, subjects, and exam preparation in a more structured and stress-free way. Instead of manually creating a timetable in a notebook or spreadsheet and then constantly changing it when plans fail, students can interact with this agent and let it handle the planning for them. The agent starts by asking the student for key information such as their subjects, upcoming exam or assignment dates, daily available study hours, and which subjects or topics they consider strong or weak. Using this information, it applies a simple scheduling logic to distribute study time across days and subjects, giving higher priority to closer exam dates and weaker areas that require extra practice. The output is a clear, day-wise study plan that tells the student exactly what to study and when, helping them avoid decision fatigue and last-minute cramming.

Beyond just generating an initial plan, Study Buddy Agent is designed to be adaptive. At the end of each day, the student can report which tasks they completed and which ones they skipped. Based on this feedback, the agent updates the schedule by moving incomplete tasks to future days and rebalancing the remaining study load, instead of forcing the student to manually rewrite their timetable. This makes the planning process dynamic and realistic, matching the way real life changes from day to day. The project is implemented in Python, using a notebook or script with clear, modular logic for input handling, scheduling, and interaction, so it can be run in environments like Kaggle Notebooks, Jupyter, or a local setup.

Study Buddy Agent was created as part of the Kaggle Agents Intensive – Capstone Project under the Concierge / Productivity Agents track, with the goal of demonstrating how AI agents can support everyday productivity rather than only complex technical tasks. Although the current version focuses mainly on generating and updating a text-based schedule, it is intentionally designed to be easy to extend. Possible future enhancements include integration with calendar tools (such as Google Calendar), reminder or notification systems, richer analytics showing study patterns and completion statistics, and additional AI support for learning content like quick revision notes, flashcards, or practice questions for each topic. Overall, Study Buddy Agent aims to act like a simple but reliable digital study companion that helps students stay consistent, focused, and better prepared for their exams.
